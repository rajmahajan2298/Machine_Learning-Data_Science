Supervised Learnig --> Have Dependended Features
-----> Output Feature
-----> Categorical ---> Classification
-----> Contnious ---> Regression

Binary Classification ---> Two Category
Mutlilevel ---> Two or more Category

Unsupervised Learning ---> No Output Features
------> We are Creating Clussters in this 

Reinforcement Learning 
-----> The Application will learns the things by itself

Equation of Straight line -

y = mx+c
ax+by+c = 0

wTx + b = 0
wTx = 0

distacne from a plane at top = +ve
distance from a plane at bottom = -ve

Instance based learning ----> Memorising
Model based learning -----> Generlizing

Simple Linearing Regression
----> The Main AIM is to create a best fit line so that the summiation of actaul and predicted point
must be minimal.

We can create best fit line by using cost functions

Types of Cost Function
(i)MSE ---> Mean Squared Error
(ii)RMSE ---> Root Mean Squared Error
(iii)MAE ---> Absloute Mean Error

Global Minima ---> We need to come to a point know as Global Minima
by changing the value of 01 and 02 the curve it is found is known as
Gradient Descent

Convergence Algoithm ---> Help how to change the value of deta to reach global
minima.
